title: Actually Obtaining Our Dream RV
---

Finding the right RV was a lot of work. In some ways it was easier than a typicall house search because your RV "home" isn't tied to a particular piece of land. However the makes, models, and floorplans however are nearly limitless, and just finding the best one for you can be an exercise in advanced search algorithms.

Being an engineer however, I saw this as a problem suited very well to my skill set. Nail, meet hammer.

## What Kind?

Our plan to travel the U.S. for a year while living in the RV full time added a few constraints which made this selction simple:

* It needs to be large enough for full-time living
* The vehicle needs to be separate for regular day to day city travel

Pretty much the only kind that satisfied those two requirements was the fifth wheel.

## Make, Model, and Floorplan

* This is where the selection exploded.
