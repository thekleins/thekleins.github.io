A few months ago Sara and I locked eyes and said, "Alright, let's do this!"

We weren't getting any younger. Neither were the kids, for that matter, and we wanted to go on an adventure. After months of exploring possibilities including but not limited to:

* Permanent move to New Zealand
* Permanent move to Switzerland (where I would while away my days building Scala and studying computer science theory under Martin Odersky, and Sara would get what in return...?)
* Exercise Pleasant Grove's new law allowing us to build a tiny home in our backyard

Sara finally said, "Let's get an RV and travel!"

I'm warning everyone - this was Sara's idea, not mine. An idea which I wholeheartedly endorse, however.

## The Idea

Practically speaking, Sara's idea was by far the best that we came up with. Some of the reasons this appealed to me were:

1. Our recent downsizing from 2500 ft² of living space to 1200 ft² was pleasant, and we definitely wanted to push that further. We are simple and utilitarian, and don't like keeping around lots of junk we don't use.
2. Since our faith transition out of Mormonism in Jan 2015 I have felt out of place as an apostate in the predominantly Mormon Utah County. (Despite very loving family.)
3. I've had occasion to visit various places as a tourist, but wanted to know what it was like to actually live elsewhere in the U.S.
4. The U.S. is huge, and I've seen only a tiny percentage of it.

## The Challenges

1. I would need a job that allows me to work remote.
2. We need an RV. Okay actually we need to figure out *what kind* of RV to buy. Well, before we can do that we need to figure out *what kinds of RVs exist*.
5. Same as 2, but for trucks that can pull RVs.
6. What do we do about our house?

Over the last couple of months we have managed to answer all of those questions and more. It's been a whirlwhind, but we now have the truck and RV of our dreams, and we'll soon be heading out on our first adventure: the solar eclipse!
