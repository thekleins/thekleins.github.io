description: Tight parking in a beautiful area. Learning how to "live" in the RV.
title: Canyon View Park
---

We left Pleasant Grove Sunday night (September 10, 2017) and drove down to Canyon View Park in Spanish Fork for our first full practice run. Cory worked the whole week and we had partial hookups which means we had electricity and water so this week was very different from our time in Idaho. When we arrived the first thing we had to do was get into our spot. This was an older park that was built before such long fifth wheels like our RV were common and the space was a bit cramped.

It took us about 20 minutes to back into our spot. We were having such a hard time the park manager finally found the person who owned the car near us and asked them to move it so we would have more space to maneuver. The whole experience was highly stressful and I was so close to just giving up and having us go home, but once we were parked things went much better for us. After we pulled up we explored the RV park as a family. There is a fishing pond, creek, playground, and tons of grass - actually a really pretty park.

Next day while Cory was working the kids and I went and explored up the Spanish Fork canyon. It is such a beautiful canyon, it is very wide and feels more like a small long valley to me and I thought it was wonderful. We pulled over at some random red rocks and explored the area and just so happened to find a geocache! The kids loved exchanging some small toys they had brought for new ones.

Then we went and played in the river. It was so scenic and it was nice to not feel in a hurry. We threw rocks in the water, splashed, explored, and simply enjoyed the moment. When we were all ready to go (really Charlie was ready and Jonny and Ben wanted to stay) we got out of the water and Jonny asks, “Is that a leech on my leg?” I told him no as I swiped his leg cleaning it up a bit. Then we washed off in a little spout near the car and Ben had one too, Jonny was right, it was a leech! Thankfully the kids weren’t too traumatized by having blood sucking leeches attached to them. It prompted us to look up leeches the next day at the library though, which was very informative.

It was fun to explore a new library and great to have new interests to look up. We also looked up a book about windmills since there are tons of windmills at the base of the canyon right near our RV park. That night Cory’s parents and sister and her kids came down to celebrate Cory’s birthday. It was fun to show those who hadn’t seen our RV around. We had ice cream cake and the kids played - it was a wonderful way to celebrate.

Cory’s sister suggested a hike close by so the next day the kids and I decided to try it out. The hike is called Dripping Rock and the trailhead is about one minute from where we were staying. I didn’t think seeing a rock drip would be very exciting, but it was beautiful! In my opinion the pictures do not do dripping rock justice. We loved seeing the dripping water, hoping from rock to rock, and throwing rocks in the stream. We actually brought Cory back here later in the week and he loved it too!

The rest of the week we went to the library a couple more times, played at their wonderful park, and explored an enchanting rose garden near the library. Cory worked part of the time in the RV and part of the time at the library. I was so impressed with the kids just leaving Cory alone for work. I was expecting it to take a few weeks for them to learn they have to leave him alone, but I didn’t even have to remind them once all week. In the evenings we had to drive back to Pleasant Grove, while leaving our RV at the site, for a birthday party and to sell our minivan.

We also had to dump our RV part way through the week since this park had only partial hookups. This was super stressful for us. We were able to get out of our spot really easily, but pointing in the opposite direction of the dump station so we went to the other entrance which is closer to the dump station thinking everything was fine, but then we heard a terrible scraping noise.

The driveway entrance was so steep that our long rig had started dragging on the pavement. Cory had to reverse back up a hill into traffic through a narrow entrance. I was no help because I had to watch the kids and keep them out of the way so we are so glad that another RV’er was there to help and was much better and giving back up directions than I am. Cory was able to get out and he just payed to dump down at the gas station because it was much easier to maneuver in that parking lot.

Saturday Cory joined us as we explored the Red Ledge picnic area. There is a patch of red rocks up the canyon and even an arch; It was amazing! It felt like we were in southern Utah.

Afterwards we tried going to fifth water hot springs, but didn’t realize how long of a hike it was and we weren’t prepared. So we just hiked along the river until we decided to turn back. While we were disappointed that we didn’t make it to the hot springs we decided to just enjoy the hike we were able to do. We expect a lot of our plans to not fully pan out and we want to be able to roll with the punches and not let the changes stop us from enjoying the beauty that does surround us.

Sunday after taking Cory to Dripping Rock we headed back up to Pleasant Grove, pleased with how our week had gone. We had filled a few boxes of things to put into storage and thought of a few more things we needed to add. We learned to be much more aware of the RV sites we are booking and make sure they meet our needs and capabilities. This trip accomplished our goals of learning how to live in the RV, work in the RV, explore the area, and get things closer to being ready at the house.
