The next weeks after Idaho were a whirlwind. We went on a family vacation with my parents to Marco Island for a week, then the next week Cory was gone in California for orientation at his new job (so he can work remote for the RV trip), then right after he got home we left for a practice run in Spanish Fork. But rewinding back to Florida.

It was amazing! Jonathan and Benjamin, but most Jonny, have an obsession with ocean animals. Jonathan went to the beach when he was just over one year old, but he obviously doesn’t remember that and we were so excited to share this experience with him - reality was just as good as we had dreamed. Going to the airport in the middle of the night you could feel the excitement coming off of the boys, none of them remembered the times they had been on an airplane and Ben hadn’t even been on one before so they were even looking forward to the travel aspect of our trip. The boys weren’t able to stay asleep very long once we got on the plane though. Jonny fell asleep before we left the ground and Ben and Charlie were in and out, but awake for lift off, then slept the rest of the way. We had a layover where Ben and Cory slept on the floor then everyone got some more sleep on the second flight.

Once we made it to our resort we went out to the beach as fast as we could. For Jonny it was instant love! He was thrilled by the waves (normally there aren’t waves at Marco Island, but because of Hurricane Harvey the ocean was wild). Ben preferred the tidal area where the water was much shallower. Charlie loved the sand and jumping the waves with assistance from daddy. 

We spent the week mostly at the beach enjoying the waves and building sand castles, and the two bigger activities that we did were boat tours. The first was a dolphin and shelling tour where we only saw one dolphin, most of them were scared away because of the storm, but that one that we saw was amazing! Charlie had not really been enjoying the boat ride, but once we saw the dolphin he was fully engaged in the activity. Charlie kept pointing at the dolphin and screaming with joy! It made the experience of seeing a dolphin triple in joy for me (and I really like seeing dolphins). The other kids enjoyed seeing the dolphin too, but got bored after a few minutes so the guide started leaving, but instantly turned back when Charlie got so sad and kept pointing back to where the dolphin was. When we got back to the dolphin Charlie was just as ecstatic. Finally we made it over to a shelling beach and it was amazing! Jonny and Benjamin love seashells - they get it from their Grammy who also came on this trip. There were seashells everywhere! You couldn’t walk without stepping on them and we found so many wonderful shells. It was great to be alone with our family and be the only ones on the beach, just walking together and enjoying the moment.

The other boat tour we did was in the everglades. For some reason Ben did not like being on the airboat, he just cried the whole time, but everyone else liked seeing the alligators in their natural habitat and the boat ride itself was really fun.

After the tour we walked around this nature preserve/zoo they have. It was so strange to see tigers and lions in the middle of the everglades, but it was wonderful.

It was a great vacation, very relaxing. We typically went to the beach in the morning and got completely tired out and came back to the room for lunch and crashed until dinner then went back out for the evening - we even saw a fire show - like the ones you would see at a Hawaiian luau. 

The flight back went almost as smoothly as our flights to Florida. Cory and I got tired of the traveling part-way through our layover, but the kids actually were well behaved even then. Marco Island we love you so much and are grateful for the experiences and joy you provided for our family. 

We got back from our Florida trip late on Saturday and then Monday Cory was on a plane to San Francisco.

A week without Cory with all three boys is a challenge for me typically, but is something that I’ve done a few times so I kind-of know how to handle the situation and pace myself. This time was still good, but very busy because I was trying to pack up the house as much as possible before Cory got back. Every day I had to homeschool, care for the kids, sort through our stuff and decide what would go to the RN and what would stay in our storage room in our house. Every morning I would spend about three hours moving things from the house to the RV and organizing it, then take care of the kids needs, then pack things into boxes and take them to the storage room, then pack things to take to the RV the next morning. I was also trying to make sure the kids had a good week and see some of our friends before we left - it was very busy. Cory enjoyed his week in San Francisco. He liked everyone he was working with and was fascinated by the city - it is so so different from Utah.

When Cory finally came home Sunday morning I was so relieved to have my teammate again! We spent the day hurriedly finishing as much as we could before leaving and then we left that same day for Spanish Fork.
