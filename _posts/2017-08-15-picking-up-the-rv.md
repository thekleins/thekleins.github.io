After much searching, I found a barely used model of our coveted Jayco Eagle 355MBQS parked at Eldora Lodge in Golden, CO. 

I know most of you are here for the pictures, so I'll start with those.

## The Pictures

## Financing

Getting the actual check to pay for the RV was actually one of the most complicated parts. Fortunately I got started 4-5 days early and went to the bank and got the process running. We financed the RV on a 12 year loan, but the credit union needed a lot of documentation from the owner because the RV was in Colorado and the loan officer couldn't inspect it.

After 3-4 days of a three-way back and forth between myself, the RV owner John, and the loan officers, I finally had a check in hand.

## The Drive

The drive out was fairly pleasant and was a great opportunity to test out the new truck. The thing sits very high, but it feels extremely stable. The sound system is amazing in it, and it has this cool feature where it adjusts the volume louder when the truck engine noise gets louder. I alternated between listening to chapters of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality and my custom EDM/pop playlist, just to exercise the awesome subwoofer, of course.

I planned to stay the night in Grand Junction at this $25 AirBnB campsite. Once I was about 2 hours out, however, it started absolutely pouring rain and when I had arrived I was not excited at all to set up my tent in the downpour. Fortunately, the host noticed my situation and upgraded me for free to his... wait for it... *tool shed*!

Haha, seriously. The host had bought one of those $700 tool sheds from Home Depot and set it up outside, then just thrown a squeaky queen sized bed in there and called it good. Heck, I wasn't complaining at all, it got me out of the rain and it was nice and dry.

The next morning I set out before sunrise because I had to get to Golden, inspect the RV, then finalize the finances before the bank closed at noon.

## The Lodge

I arrived at the Eldora Lodge as planned at 9:45 and first laid my eyes on the RV. I was impressed with how immaculate it was! I quickly found John and his wife Lydia and we did a quick inspection of the RV before John and I carpooled to the bank and back. Once the money was settled, we were all much more relaxed and spent the next 2 hours exploring and talking about the RV.

As it turns out Lydia has a lot of connections to Utah polygamists! Since I've been listening to the Year of Polygamy podcast, I was extremely intrigued. Out of respect for her and others privacy I won't talk about it too much, but I was surprised to find out just how common polygamist families are in my neighborhood.

John and Lydia were both extremely nice and I was sad I couldn't stay longer, but I soon bid them farewell and John helped me hitch up the RV.

## My First Big Hauler

### Getting Out Of The Canyon

Oh my gosh I was so nervous!! This RV is over forty feet long and weighs about 6 tons unloaded. I had never pulled anything longer than a 10' trailer.

Pulling out of the lodge, you could definitely feel the RV behind you. The truck has to work much harder just to accelerate, and going down the hill the RV pushes the truck. Fortunately John had pointed out some button on my truck. One connects my brake pedal to the trailer's brakes, giving you more stopping power. The other turns on the engine brakes when you're coasting downhill. I don't know how I could have gotten out of the canyon without knowing about those, thanks John!

Funny thing - after about one mile, all the cars were stopped in front of me on the road. Turns out there was a huge bike race, and the road was closed for an hour! I was already late and after discovering this I resigned to splitting up the return trip into two days.

Once the race cleared up getting out of the canyon was pretty simple. I was surprised how well the fifth wheel follows behind the truck, I just stayed in the center of my lane and the fifth wheel followed pretty well.

### City Driving

Driving in the city was a bit more nerve wracking. First of all, it started pouring rain again. Second of all, somebody cut me off and then slammed on their brakes at a red light. The road was very slick and I started to slide when I slammed on my brakes, but I pulled to the right (fortunately not crashing into anyone) and avoided a collision.

Lesson learned? Stopping distance is **huge** with this RV behind me.

All the corners I turned on had a pretty wide margin, and I took them all very wide and didn't have any close calls on tight turns.

### On The Freeway

Once I got on the freeway I accelerated up to about 75 mph. Soon thereafter, a Colorado crosswind came by and the trailer started fish tailing very strongly.

Queue my second panic attack.

<sub>*Imagine this with a 40' RV. Okay mine wasn't quite that bad, but this is what it felt like.*</sub>

This is when I also learned about a third towing feature of my truck: it somehow knows when this is happening and slams on the brakes for you! Who knows how many lives were saved last Saturday because of whatever civil engineer at Dodge built that button. *Thank you anonymous Dodge engineer!*

Over several hours I learned to cope with the fish tailing by driving slower and by letting off the gas whenever it happened and no more extreme incidents occured.

## My First RV Park

I picked the cheapest RV park in Grand Junction to stay the night. No grass in site, gravel everywhere, and dilapidated double-wides for neighbors. Funny thing though, as soon as you get in the RV you have this beautiful interior and you forget about what is outside. I slept like a baby.

When I woke up in the morning my door was cracked open. My work laptop was sitting out, perfectly un-stolen, so I think it was just a bit of settling. They can't really build the frames in a way that the doors are always securely shut.

## Home

The rest of the drive went fairly smoothly. I had gotten the hang of towing my big rig and the weather was great. I did run out of downloaded Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality podcast episodes during a period where cell phone reception was as ubiquitous as rain in the Sahara and I wasn't super happy about that, but nobody died.

I pulled in at home right around the same time that the neighborhood church got out. The next hour was the most pleasant flurry of hugs and kisses from my little boys, excited screams and cheers as every nook and cranny of the RV was explored, and excited neighbors come to get a tour.

As for now, today is my last day of work at Domo. I'll be spending the next week getting ready to take the RV to the solar eclipse in Idaho, and I'm more excited than ever to start our adventure!
