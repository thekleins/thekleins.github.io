description: Nice real RV park, close to family, got to see a play
title: Cedar City

Our second (or third, depending on how you count) practice run in the RV was down to Cedar City. Technically it was Kannaraville, but we mostly went because two of my sisters live in Cedar City.

This RV park worked so much better for us. The spot wasn’t a pull through, but it was very easy to get into and it was full hookups which means we also had sewer available. We drove down on Friday and got settled in.

Saturday we tried hiking to Kanarraville Falls. We got pretty close, but everyone coming down the trail said that shortly we would have no choice but to walk in the stream. It was a bit cold and the water was really cold so that wasn’t really an option for us so we turned around. We still got a great view of Kanarraville and had a beautiful hike! Then we went and hung out with my sister and her family (she has three kids close in age to our kids). It was so fun to spend time with them! We loved showing them them our RV and we even all played Overcooked on the Switch with them. Then they babysat our kids while Cory and I went to the play Tavern at the Shakespearean festival. It wasn’t a Shakespeare play, but it was hilarious and it was so fun to have a date night!

Sunday my mom drove down to Cedar to drop off my other sister for college and everyone came over and played Overcooked again, it was great to spend time with a lot of my family before leaving for so long.

The next few days we went to story time at the library with my sister and her kids, played at the park a lot, and enjoyed time with family. We went and saw my sister’s dorm and the kids loved seeing where she is living. I also took family pictures of my sister with her family and it was so fun to be able to do that, but we realized it is starting to get cold and even though we are planning to follow the warmer weather during our trip sometimes we might want our warmer/winter clothes. The biggest activity we did was going to the Parowan Gap with both my sisters. It was amazing to see these random outcroppings of rock when everything around is flat. Then the petroglyphs we saw were so fascinating. From looking at the plaques the kids had decided the ocean was on the other side of the outcropping. When we got there there was a dirt road with several big puddles - so they said the ocean had dried up and this was all that was left haha, cute kids.

We left on Wednesday in the morning. I drove the RV (I can’t believe I did that!) and Cory worked from the car on the drive home. This system worked pretty well and helped to accommodate the extra travel on a work day. While this trip wasn’t as long it was really enjoyable.
