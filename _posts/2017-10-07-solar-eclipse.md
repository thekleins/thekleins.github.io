description: Our first RV trip to the deserts of Idaho for the Great American Solar
  Eclipse.

Our first trip with our new RV was a trial by fire. The solar eclipse was coming up fast so we decided to take our RV up to Idaho to see this amazing phenomenon. We wanted to be under the path of totality without driving to far (like Wyoming) and that put us in the middle of no where. Google maps showed a nice dirt road that crossed the eclipse’s path, but it didn’t show that it was incredibly bumpy and narrow. Definitely a challenge when towing 40 feet of recreational vehicle. Once we arrived at the start of the dirt road we were excited and forged on with enthusiasm, but it took us an hour to go about a mile and then another half an hour to park somewhere relatively flat, finally getting to sleep around 2:00 AM. In retrospect we should have camped closer to the main road and walked the rest of the way to totality during the eclipse, but once we got all set up we were able to enjoy the next few days in comfort.

The next morning we woke up amazed that we could sleep in our beds, have air conditioning, and a real kitchen when we couldn’t see anything but small hills and sage brush all around us. We enjoyed the comfort of the RV during the hot days and cold nights but enjoyed exploring the desert during the more moderate morning and evenings. We spent the day exploring the area and we was surprised that there were actually interesting things to find. Sometimes life can seem so mundane, but there is joy and adventure to be found everywhere. Even though there wasn’t a lot in the area the boys found joy in every bug, bush, and railroad tie and they were able to share that joy with us. The area is apparently used for shooting practice and the boys voraciously hunted for bullet casings and beat up tin cans sporting the signature welts and holes of a good target practice.

We were not far from some railroad tracks and as we approached them for the first time a train passed by which was exciting, but the dearth of trains over the next few days meant it was a stroke of luck we saw a train at all. It was truly idyllic to be walking along the railroad tracks with sage brush lining the path, holding hands at with some family while the rest excitedly examined the surroundings. Later on the boys returned to put coins down on the track to get smashed by a train. (They ended up getting smashed by a truck with train wheels instead of an actual train, but that didn’t make a difference to the boys.)

At some point during the day we realized that even though we had fully filled our fresh water tank before coming, by the time we arrived it was somehow only one third full! We were worried that we wouldn’t have enough water but Cory’s sister, who was to arrive the next day, graciously brought a few large jugs to supplement. We had to ration and wash dishes in two inches of water, but we made it through the end of the trip without running out. Lesson learned: when dry camping bring paper and plastic.

## Even Better With Friends

Cory’s sister and her family (husband and three kids) arrived the second night. The men immediately set about trying to figure out why the RV wouldn’t detach from the truck. After much experimentation they finally deduced the cause: Cory never removed the safety pin from the hitch! Rookie mistake.

They camped in a tent near us, but spent a good deal of the time together with us inside the RV. We were all so excited that they were able to come with; especially the kids who now had little friends to play with. The kids all tried to sleep together in the loft bed, but in the end our boys all migrated to the couch, their oldest stayed on the boys’ loft, and their two youngest joined their mom and dad in the tent outside. We were impressed overall with how comfortable and not-cramped the RV was even with another five-person family joining us.

The next morning the boys were excited to share the things they had discovered in the Idaho desert with their cousins. They played and explored together all day. After much trial and error (and a couple of frantic spills) Cory and his brother-in-law were able to figure how to siphon the water jugs into the RV tank; such amazing handy men! Later the kids watched a movie together while the adults all played a game of Puerto Rico.

## The *ECLIPSE*

Waking up Monday morning felt a bit like Christmas morning, at least for Cory it did, because the eclipse was to start at 10:30! We had a relaxed start to the day, then just before 10:30 we got chairs and snacks set up outside in preparation. For the next hour everyone would occasionally admire the eclipse through our eclipse glasses.

The kids were slightly impressed but mostly just enjoyed running around in the sage bush. Jonny caught a lizard and brought it back to camp to show everyone his amazing discovery.

Uncle looked up the lizard on the internet and we decided it is probably a horned toad lizard. Everyone was impressed with Jonny’s skill in catching the lizard and with all the other kids bravery for holding such a thorny looking lizard.

The kids quickly became attached to the lizard and we decided to bring him home with us and take him on our RV trip. His name is Lizardy and his nickname is Pokey, although the nickname now suffers from disuse.

When totality neared everyone grabbed their glasses and hiked to the top of a nearby hill. As we were waiting sweet Benjamin, sensing the darkening of the surroundings kept begging, “Please can I stay up late past bed time?” As totality crept closer and closer we were shocked at how cold and dark it was getting, especially since the sun itself didn’t look any different without the glasses on. Finally totality!!! It was awe inspiring. With the sun fully blocked we took off our glasses and we were able to see the corona, which was my favorite part. The amazing beams bursting out from around the moon were shimmering and dancing, it felt like magic - pure and beautiful. Cory brought his binoculars and everyone looked at Mercury (which you normally can’t see because it is so close to the sun). Venus and Mars were also visible. The next best part was the sunset/sunrise effect that was all around us. It was amazing because there weren’t any buildings so we could see 360 degrees around us clearly and the colors were beautiful.

As the sun peaked out behind the moon it burst with strength and in that instant you couldn’t look without donning your glasses again. The power of the sun is shocking; it was probably 99.9% covered, but you couldn’t look at it directly and couldn’t tell by looking at the sun sans glasses that it was being blocked by the moon. As the sun further regained its strength we could feel everything around us getting brighter and warmer, but for the most part we just went back to enjoying our trip while only occasionally looking at the sun through the glasses.

Cory’s sister and family packed up and left immediately after totality, hoping to avoid most of the traffic going home. We opted to stay until the next day for the same reason. 

## Just Regular Life

Later that day, our oldest son Jonny had his first day of kindergarten! In order to keep up with schooling while we travel this year we have opted to homeschool Jonathan his kindergarten curriculum and Benjamin some preschool exercises as well. I think they both really enjoyed the work we did and I was pleased we could still have school anywhere we go!

That night I started going a bit crazy with the lack of interesting things to do and entertain the kids, but it was the last night so we got through it. Next day we packed up and after trying to turn the RV around for about 20 minutes we decided to give up and take the scenic route back to the highway. In the end, the scenic route cost us nearly two hours and we were kicking ourselves for not trying harder to just sacrifice a few sage brush and turn the RV around from the start. You don’t realize how fast walking is until you tow an RV at two miles an hour through the bumpy desert. But we made it! Then we continued home; besides one accident that exacerbated the heavier than usual traffic, the ride was blessedly uneventful. 

## The Beginning Is The End Is The Beginning

As our first real RV trip it was certainly a trial by fire but we had a blast and learned so much. The eclipse made such an impression we vowed to experience one (or several) more in person during our lifetime. Afterwards we asked our kids what they liked about the trip. Jonny remembered “sage brush, tons of sand… also Lizardy!!” While Benjamin remembered “climbing up a mountain.”
